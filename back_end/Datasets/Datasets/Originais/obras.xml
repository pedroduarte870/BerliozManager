   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Polonaise-fantaisie in A-flat major, Op. 61, is a composition for piano by Frédéric Chopin. It was dedicated to Mme A. Veyret, and published in 1846.It opens with Allegro maestoso, 3/4 time. This work was slow to gain favour with musicians, due to its harmonic complexity and intricate form.  Arthur Hedley was one of the first critics to speak in its favour, writing in 1947 that it &#39;works on the hearer&#39;s imagination with a power of suggestion equalled only by the F minor Fantasy or the fourth Ballade&#39;, although Arthur Rubinstein, Leff Pouishnoff, Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz had been including it in their programmes some decades earlier.It is intimately indebted to the polonaise for its metre, much of its rhythm, and some of its melodic character, but the fantaisie is the operative formal paradigm (Samson, 1988), and Chopin is said to have referred initially to the piece only as a Fantasy. Parallels with the Fantaisie in F minor include the work&#39;s overall tonality, A-flat, the key of its slower middle section, B major, and the motive of the descending fourth.Jeffrey Kallberg has suggested that the Polonaise-Fantaisie represents a change in Chopin&#39;s style from &#39;late&#39; to &#39;last&#39;.  It is suggested that the formal ambiguities of the piece (particularly the unconventional and musically misleading transitions into and out of the lyrical inner section) are the most significant defining qualities of this &#39;last style&#39;, which only includes this and one other piece; the unfinished F minor Mazurka (Op. 68, No. 4).</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">Transcendental Étude No. 8 in C minor &quot;Wilde Jagd&quot; (Wild Hunt) is the eighth étude in the twelve Transcendental Études by Franz Liszt.The 1837 version of this piece is in sonata form, with a first subject in C minor, second subject in E-flat major, and a recapitulation of the first subject.  It is monothematic (the second subject material is derived from the first subject material).  Liszt removed the final recapitulation of the first subject in the 1851 version of the piece, along with an extended bravura passage preceding it.The piece starts with a furious quick main theme, left hand playing the melody in octaves and the right hand playing the same melody one octave higher alternatively, quickly followed with chords. The furious main theme flows into the playful melody of the secondary subject. When actually played at the original speed that Liszt indicated (&quot;Presto furioso&quot;, or fast and furious; at around 4 and a half minutes), the piece quickly becomes formidable. Wide jumps in the beginning span about three octaves in the right hand. The lyrical middle section involves some difficult left-hand jumps rapidly spanning over two octaves.  The ending involves a difficult section of octave jumps in the right hand spanning three octaves. The piece ends in a flurry of descending chords.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Eight Short Preludes and Fugues are a collection of works for keyboard and pedal formerly attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach. They are now believed to have been composed by one of Bach&#39;s pupils, possibly Johann Tobias Krebs or his son Johann Ludwig Krebs, based on certain unusual characteristics of the music when played on the organ. These pieces came to be played often on the organ in the 19th and 20th centuries, and were especially useful as teaching pieces for beginners. Subsequent scholarship by Speerstra, Vogel and others has suggested that this collection was conceived specifically for the pedal clavichord, thereby making the stylistic claim of inauthenticity far less tenable. Several elements of the pieces, including the rolling of large chords, octave doublings and repeated notes, and the patterns of movement of the fingers and feet, the rhythm, and overall texture are idiomatic on the clavichord but make little sense on the organ. Performer Harald Vogel has recorded the collection on a pedal clavichord along with an essay by Speerstra (see liner notes) on the clavichordistic nature of these pieces and a discussion of the manuscript indications.These works continue to be performed frequently in Christian churches because of their short length (about 3 minutes each) and ease of performance compared to preludes and fugues attributed with greater certainty to J.S. Bach. The alternate English title, &quot;Eight Little Preludes and Fugues&quot; (&quot;Huit Petits&quot; in French) is also common because Kleine means &quot;little&quot; not &quot;short&quot;.</literal></binding>

It was composed when he was a student at the Moscow Conservatory, and is one of his earliest surviving compositions for orchestra. A typical performance of the work lasts from sixteen to twenty minutes.It is written in D minor and uses the instruments in a personal way. Melodies are more individual and the orchestral textures are quite evocative. Prince Rostislav has echoes of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#39;s Sadko (second version, 1869).The manuscript is dated 9–15 December 1891. The work is based upon an 1856 ballad written by Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, called Prince Rostislav.Unlike his next orchestal piece, The Rock, Prince Rostislav contains no dedication. Rachmaninoff made no attempt to have the work performed during his life. The first performance of both Prince Rostislav and another early work, the Scherzo in D minor, took place in Moscow on 2 November 1945, conducted by Nikolai Anosoff.  Prince Rostislav was published in 1947.</literal></binding>

The composition features an unbroken line of quaver triplets in the left hand set against a slow melody of minims, crotchets, quaver duplets and triplets. It consists of 57 bars of common time with the tempo given as Andante, 69 bpm.File:Chopin Nocturne in Em, Op. posth. 72.oggAn informal analysis of the piece is as follows:Bar 1: Introduction, First Subject.Bar 2-9: Theme A, in E minor.Bar 10-17: Variation on theme A, beginning with octaves in the right hand.Bar 18-22: InterludeBar 23-30: Theme B, in B major, consisting of a four bar phrase, repeated with variation, Second Subject.Bar 31-38: Heavily ornamented variation on A, in E minor, First Subject again.Bar 39-46: Variation on theme A, beginning with octaves in the right hand.Bar 47-54: Theme B, modulated to E major, Second Subject again.Bar 55-57: Coda in E major.According to Casimir Wierzyknski, in his book, The Life and Death of Chopin, &quot;[U]p until then this form [the nocturne] had been the exclusive domain of John Field, an Irish-born composer. But his Nocturne in E minor did not satisfy him [Chopin] and was published only posthumously.&quot;This piece was played by the actor Jeri Lynn Zimmermann Ryan while portraying Seven of Nine in the beginning of the Star Trek Voyager episode &quot;Human Error&quot;.

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Ballades, Op. 10 are lyrical piano pieces written by Johannes Brahms during his youth.  They were dated 1854 and were dedicated to his friend Julius Otto Grimm.  Their composition coincided with the beginning of the composer&#39;s lifelong affection for Clara Schumann, the wife of Robert Schumann, who was helping Brahms launch his career.  Frédéric Chopin had written the last of his famous ballades only 12 years earlier, but Brahms approached the genre differently from Chopin, choosing to take its origin in narrative poetry more literally.Brahms&#39;s ballades are arranged in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in parallel keys.  The first ballade was inspired by a Scottish poem &quot;Edward&quot; found in a collection Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder.  It is also one of the best examples of Brahms&#39;s bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past.   No. 1 in D minor.  Andante No. 2 in D major.  Andante No. 3 in B minor.  Intermezzo.  Allegro No. 4 in B major.  Andante con motoThe tonal center of each ballade conveys an interconnectedness between the four pieces: the first three each include the key signature of the ballade that follows it somewhere as a tonal center, and the fourth ends in the key signature of D major/B minor despite cadencing in B major.  Brahms returned to the wordless ballade form in writing the third of the Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118.  His Op. 75 vocal duets titled &quot;Ballads and Romances&quot; include a setting of the poem &quot;Edward&quot;—the same that inspired Op. 10, No. 1.A number of famous pianists have played some or all of the Ballades, including Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Artur Rubinstein, Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, Glenn Gould, Wilhelm Kempff, Julius Katchen, Krystian Zimerman and Claudio Arrau.</literal></binding>

It can be considered a passacaglia or a chaconne, with a repeating D, F, E bass line. It is perhaps Marais&#39; most famous composition that explores the various techniques of the viol, an instrument he studied as a student of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe.The work begins with 4 measures of the bass line played by the continuo and viol, then, on the 5th measure the violin takes over the melody. Throughout the piece, the violin and viol take turns with the melody.The viol part is of great difficulty because of Marais&#39;s mastery of that instrument. The centerpiece is not the melody, the violin, but the viol. His work can be thought of as something to showcase the violist&#39;s skill, although it does not always have the melody.The piece also exists in a version for solo double bass, having been arranged by Norman Ludwin for Ludwin Music.  An electronic version on a Fairlight synthesizer was used in the soundtrack of the 1982 film &quot;Liquid Sky&quot;.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">Alexander Scriabin&#39;s Prelude in C major, Op. 11, No. 1, was composed in November 1895 in Moscow. Here Scriabin&#39;s virtuosic sustain pedaling assembles clusters of up to seven different diatonic notes in an exquisite sonority that Scriabin himself used to describe as a &quot;psychic shift&quot;. The whole melody of this prelude consists of 240 eighth-notes,  being the opening chord of this piece C–D–E–F–G–A, with the C-major tonic in the bass. The time value for each eighth note changes whenever the tempo flexes, as can be noticed in the second group of notes in the 2nd bar, which measures less than half the tempo of the second group in the 14th bar. This piece has 36 bars and takes about one minute to be played with  a Vivace tempo marking.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">Vers la flamme (&quot;Toward the flame&quot;), Op. 72, is one of Alexander Scriabin&#39;s last pieces for piano, written in 1914.The melody of the piece is very simple, consisting mainly of descending half steps. However, the unusual harmonies and difficult tremolos create an intense, fiery luminance. This piece was intended to be Scriabin&#39;s eleventh sonata; however, he had to publish it early because of financial concerns. Hence, the piece is only labeled a poem, rather than a sonata.  According to pianist Vladimir Horowitz, the piece was inspired by Scriabin&#39;s eccentric conviction that a constant accumulation of heat would ultimately cause the destruction of the world. The piece&#39;s title reflects the Earth&#39;s fiery destruction, and the constant emotional buildup and crescendo throughout the piece lead, ultimately, &quot;toward the flame&quot;.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">Suite No. 2, Op. 17, is a composition for two pianos by Sergei Rachmaninoff.This work was composed in Italy in the first months of 1901, and like the famous second piano concerto, Op.18, it confirms the comeback of the creativity of the composer after four years of silence since the flop of his first symphony.   The Suite was first performed on November 24, 1901, by the composer and his cousin Alexander Siloti.In contrast to the First Suite for two pianos, the work is not based on literature, and the form tends to approach the traditional suite.  The movements are:I. Introduction (Alla marcia, in C major) II. Valse (Presto, in G major) III. Romance (Andantino, in A flat major) IV.  Tarantelle (Presto, in C minor) The most famous performance of this piece was in Los Angeles in the early 1940s, just before Rachmaninoff died.  He and Vladimir Horowitz were at a party and played the piece, the first and only time they ever did.Perhaps surprisingly, given that Rachmaninoff wrote orchestral and two-piano versions of his Symphonic Dances, which is effectively a three-movement symphony, no one has orchestrated this Suite as a possible symphony.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Variations and Fugue for Piano in E♭ major, Op. 35 are a set of fifteen variations for solo piano composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1802.  They are commonly referred to as the Eroica Variations because variations on the same theme were used as the finale of his Symphony No. 3 Eroica composed the following year. Musicologists Leon Plantinga and Alexander Ringer claim that the inspiration for the Eroica theme may have come from Classical era composer Muzio Clementi. Platinga theorizes that a source may be Clementi&#39;s Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 13, No. 6 (composed in 1784) where the first seven or eight notes of the Eroica theme can be matched, with a simpler rhythm, with the beginning of the third movement (in a minor key), and later to the melody in a major key (the Eroica theme is in a major key although there are variations in minor keys). Ringer points to the first movement of the Piano Sonata in G minor, Op. 7, No. 3 (composed in 1782) as a possible source, where the melody (in a minor key) and rhythm closely match the first eight bars of the Eroica theme. (A major version also exists in the movement, matching very closely the melody in the major key from the F minor, Op. 13, No. 6 sonata).The theme was a favorite of Beethoven&#39;s. He used it in the finale of the ballet music he composed for The Creatures of Prometheus (1801) as well as for the seventh of his 12 Contredanses, WoO 14 (1800-02), before being the subject of the variations of this work and of the later symphony. It begins thus:550pxIn a departure from the classical theme-and-variations form, Beethoven opens the work not with the main theme, but the bass line to the main theme.  He then follows with three variations of this bass line before finally stating the main theme.  This approach was carried over from the ballet music, where it represented the gradual creation of life forms by Prometheus. The variations in the Eroica Symphony follow this same pattern. In another departure from traditional variation form,  after the fifteen variations of the main theme, Beethoven finishes the work with a finale consisting of a fugue followed by an Andante con moto.The work lasts about 25 minutes.</literal></binding>

It was published in December 1785 together with the Sonata in C minor, K. 457, as Opus 11 by the publishing firm Artaria, Mozart’s main Viennese publisher. Starting in the key of C minor, the piece is marked Adagio but then, after a section in D major, moves into an allegro section which goes from A minor to G minor, F major, and then F minor. It then moves into a fourth section in B-flat major marked Andantino and then moves to a più allegro section starting in G minor and modulating through many keys before the opening theme returns in the original tonic key of C minor--the remainder of the piece is, for the first time, grounded in this key, in which it comes to a very firm end. Due to its sometimes surprising key changes, most of the music is written with no sharps or flats in the key signature and uses accidentals--only the fourth section, in a very solid B-flat major, is given a key signature. The music, like Mozart&#39;s other fantasies, is thought of as quite technically demanding.</literal></binding>

The work is meant to represent a masked ball and was inspired by the Jean Paul&#39;s novel Flegeljahre.The suite begins with a six-measure introduction before launching into a variety of dance-like movements. Each movement is unrelated to the preceding ones, except that the second, A major, theme of the sixth movement recurs in G major in the tenth movement and the theme of the first movement returns in the finale. This movement starts out by quoting the theme of the traditional Grossvater Tanz (Grandfather&#39;s Dance), which was always played at the end of a wedding or similar celebration.  Repeated notes near the end of the piece suggest a clock striking, signifying the end of the ball.</literal></binding>

It received its first public performance in Antwerp, Belgium on 21 July 1896.Dedicated to the organ builder and keen amateur musician Edward W Whinfield,  it is approximately 12 minutes in duration.Although not formally published until 1892, the Serenade is believed to be a reworking of a suite Elgar had written some years earlier, before he had firmly set his sights on a career as a composer. Apart from the two suites called The Wand of Youth, it is therefore probably the earliest of his compositions to survive into the standard repertoire. Certainly, it has a youthful charm while at the same time displaying indications of the skills Elgar developed as he progressed towards musical maturity. It is reportedly the first of his compositions with which he professed himself satisfied.The central Larghetto is generally accepted as containing the work&#39;s finest and most mature writing. The work remains among the most frequently performed of all his music.</literal></binding>

It was also his last, for Scriabin died soon after.Leonid Sabaneyev cites the composer with the following words: &quot;These quints are really creating a totally new sentiment, don&#39;t you think? [...] These harmonies are less resonant here, but look how highly psychologically difficult it has become. [...] Here reigns a blazing heat like in the [astral] desert.

Either coloured by manifold nuances, or, quite the opposite, completely uniform, without the least shading. [...] in one single piece, there are multiple ones laid out, a multiplicity of the composition.&quot; - &quot;Until now I always composed so that the interpretation of a piece was only possible in one way [...] Now I want it to be possible to be played in totally different ways, like a crystal can reflect totally different rays of light.&quot; - He said, quietly and hauntingly, &quot;This is death!

The left hand leaps intervals of up to a tenth (octave plus a third) between the bass and the lowest note of the following chord (and back): this requires a very strong left hand 5th finger. Very often, the performer is required to hold the uppermost note of the right hand in legato while continuing to play the rest of the chord in that hand (and in the left hand) as staccato: this requires a very strong right hand 5th finger.

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">Ludwig van Beethoven wrote his Mass in C major, Op. 86, to a commission from Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II in 1807.  In fulfilling this commission, Beethoven was extending a tradition established by Joseph Haydn, who following his return from England in 1795 had composed one mass per year for the Esterházy family, to celebrate the name day of the Prince&#39;s wife.  Haydn had ceased this tradition with the failure of his health in 1802.Prince Nikolaus did not appreciate the mass, causing Beethoven to leave his house in a rage.  Charles Rosen, in The Classical Style, has called the episode Beethoven&#39;s &quot;most humiliating public failure&quot;.  The mass is appreciated by critics (such as Rosen), but is probably one of the least often performed of Beethoven&#39;s larger works.  Of the work,  Michael Moore writes &quot;While [it] is often overshadowed by the immense Missa Solemnis, written some fifteen years later, it has a directness and an emotional content that the latter work sometimes lacks.&quot; The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs (2004 edition) forthrightly calls the work a &quot;long-underrated masterpiece.&quot;</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">Syrinx, L. 129, is a piece of music for solo flute which Claude Debussy wrote in 1913. It generally takes three minutes or less to perform. It was the first significant piece for solo flute after the Sonata in A minor composed by C. P. E. Bach 150 years before (1763), and it is the first such solo composition for the modern Böhm flute, perfected in 1847.Syrinx is commonly considered to be an indispensable part of any flautist&#39;s repertoire.  Many musical historians believe that &quot;Syrinx&quot;, which gives the performer generous room for interpretation and emotion, played a pivotal role in the development of solo flute music in the early twentieth century.  Some say Syrinx was originally written by Debussy without barlines or breath marks.  The flautist Marcel Moyse may have later added these, and most publishers publish Moyse&#39;s edition. The piece is commonly performed off stage, as it is thought when Debussy dedicated the piece to the flautist Louis Fleury, it was for him to play during the interval of one of Debussy&#39;s ballets.Syrinx was written as incidental music to the uncompleted play Psyché by Gabriel Mourey, and was originally called &quot;Flûte de Pan&quot;.  Since one of Debussy&#39;s Chansons de Bilitis had already been given that title, however, it was given its final name in reference to the myth of the amorous pursuit of the nymph Syrinx by the god Pan, in which Pan falls in love with Syrinx, however, as Syrinx does not return the love to Pan, she turns herself into a water reed and hides in the marshes. Pan cuts the reeds to make his pipes, in turn killing his love.Syrinx has also been transposed and performed on the saxophone and other instruments. It quickly became a piece of standard literature for the saxophone, and has been recorded on both the alto and soprano saxophones.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">Tapiola (literally, &quot;Realm of Tapio&quot;), Op. 112, is a tone poem by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius, written in 1926. It was the product of a commission from Walter Damrosch for the New York Philharmonic Society. Tapiola portrays Tapio, the animating forest spirit mentioned throughout the Kalevala, lurking behind the stark Finnish pine-forests that enveloped Sibelius&#39;s isolated home Ainola outside Järvenpää.It was premiered by Walter Damrosch and the New York Symphonic Society on 26 December 1926.When asked by the publisher to clarify the work&#39;s program, Sibelius responded by supplying a quatrain:Widespread they stand, the Northland&#39;s dusky forests,Ancient, mysterious, brooding savage dreams;Within them dwells the Forest&#39;s mighty God,And wood-sprites in the gloom weave magic secrets.Tapiola was Sibelius&#39;s last major work, though he lived for another thirty years. He began working on an Eighth Symphony, but he is said to have burned the sketches after becoming unhappy with the work.A typical performance of Tapiola lasts between fifteen and twenty minutes. It is scored for three flutes (third doubling piccolo), two oboes, English Horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings. The original publisher was Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, who published most of Sibelius&#39;s works.Robert Kajanus conducted the London Symphony Orchestra for HMV on 29 June 1932 at Abbey Road Studio 1 in the first recording of Tapiola.In 1953 Herbert von Karajan conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in the first of his four recordings of the work. (Sibelius regarded Karajan as &quot;the only one who truly understands my work.&quot;) Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recorded the music in 1955; it was one of the first stereophonic recordings made by EMI Classics. Both before and since then, numerous conductors and orchestras have recorded the work.</literal></binding>

Koreli), Op. 42, is set of variations for solo piano, written in 1931 by the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.  He composed them at his holiday home in Switzerland.The theme is La Folia, which was not in fact composed by Arcangelo Corelli, but was used by him in 1700 as the basis for 23 variations in his Sonata for violin and continuo (violone and/or harpsichord) in D minor, Op. 5, No. 12.  La Folia was popularly used as the basis for variations in Baroque music.  Franz Liszt used the same theme in his Rhapsodie espagnole S. 254 (1863).Rachmaninoff dedicated the work to his friend the violinist Fritz Kreisler.  He wrote to another friend, the composer Nikolai Medtner, on 21 December 1931: I&#39;ve played the Variations about fifteen times, but of these fifteen performances only one was good. The others were sloppy.  I can&#39;t play my own compositions!  And it&#39;s so boring!  Not once have I played these all in continuity.  I was guided by the coughing of the audience. Whenever the coughing would increase, I would skip the next variation.  Whenever there was no coughing, I would play them in proper order.  In one concert, I don&#39;t remember where - some small town - the coughing was so violent that I played only ten variations (out of 20).  My best record was set in New York, where I played 18 variations.  However, I hope that you will play all of them, and won&#39;t &quot;cough&quot;.Rachmaninoff recorded many of his own works, but not this piece.</literal></binding>

The incidental music was first performed in Christiania on 10 April 1872. The suite was premiered in Oslo on 5 November 1892, and revised by the composer the same year.The suite is in nine parts, three of which are more widely known than the remainder (these three are the only purely instrumental numbers). The first of these, titled &quot;In the King&#39;s Hall&quot;, is a prelude in ternary form which opens with a bassoon and clarinet theme played against plucked strings. The musical material of the exterior sections comes from the trio of a gavotte for piano that Grieg composed in 1867 and left unpublished.  The second, &quot;Borghild&#39;s Dream&quot;, is an intermezzo contrasting a sensitive string melody with an agitated section.  The third, &quot;Homage March&quot;, opens with trumpet fanfares before presenting its main subject, a martial theme, on four cellos.  The middle part, again a trio, is dominated by a melody for the first violins; the work ends with a recapitulation of the movement&#39;s first section.Full list: Fanfare of Horns Prelude to act 1 Borghild&#39;s Dream The Matching Game Northern Folk Homage March Interlude 1 Interlude 2 The Kings&#39; Song</literal></binding>

As these elements are treated rather freely initially he intended this piece to be called Italian Fantasia. Tchaikovsky even uses as the introduction a bugle call that he overheard from his hotel played by Italian cavalry regiment. Another source of inspiration for this piece are Mikhail Glinka&#39;s Spanish Pieces.The premiere was held in Moscow on December 18 of the same year; the orchestra was led by Nikolai Rubinstein. Although Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck that the work would be successful (the piece was praised by most critics) by the time he came to orchestrate the work he expressed doubts about its musical substance.Dedicated to Karl Davydov, the Capriccio was later arranged by the composer for 4-hand piano.

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Eleven Bagatelles, Op. 119 were written by Ludwig van Beethoven between the 1790s and the early 1820s. By the end of 1803, he had already sketched bagatelles Nos. 1 through 5 (along with several other short works for piano that he never published). In 1820, he composed the last five bagatelles of Op. 119, and published them as a set of five in 1821. The following year, he revised his old bagatelle sketches to construct a new collection for publication, adding a final bagatelle, No. 6, composed in late 1822. He then sent off this set of six to England for publication in 1823, along with Nos. 7 through 11, which had not yet been published in England.The English publisher printed all eleven bagatelles together as one collection, and it is unclear to what degree this represents the composer&#39;s intentions. Some scholars have argued that the two halves of Op. 119 — Nos. 1 through 6, and Nos. 7 through 11 — are best thought of as separate collections. However, it is also possible that when Beethoven composed No. 6 in late 1822, he had already planned to send all eleven pieces to England. In that case, No. 6 would not be meant as a conclusion to the first five, but as a way to connect them with the latter five. The key relationship and thematic similarities between No. 6 and No. 7 support this hypothesis, as does the fact that in subsequent correspondence, Beethoven expressed only satisfaction with how the bagatelles were published in England.A typical performance of Op. 119 lasts around fourteen minutes.G minor.

Grieg deeply respected his fellow musician and took no delay in producing the work. The march was originally written as a piano piece in A minor; Grieg also produced transcriptions of it for brass choir and wind band, in B♭ minor.Grieg valued the work greatly, bringing it along on all of his travels. In one letter he made it clear that he wished the piece to be played at his own funeral, &quot;as best as possible.&quot; It was played, in an orchestration by Grieg&#39;s friend and colleague Johan Halvorsen.The work has a few arrangements by later musicians, including one by Geoffrey Emerson. It lasts six to eight minutes, depending on the arrangement and tempo.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Rondo à la mazur in F major, Op. 5, was written by Polish composer, Frédéric Chopin in 1826, when he was 16, and published in 1828.  It was the second of his four rondos, and is dedicated to the Countess Alexandrine de Moriolles, the daughter of the Comte de Moriolles, who was the tutor to the adopted son of the Grand Duke Constantine, Governor of Warsaw.  It is the only one of the four rondos not written in 2/4 time.Chopin wrote the piece while studying at the Warsaw Conservatory.  It is a bravura piece, and technically more assured than his Opus 1, the Rondo in C minor.  His teacher Józef Elsner had also written two rondos marked à la mazur, and they may have inspired the title, but Chopin&#39;s rondo displays none of Elsner&#39;s influence.  Instead, there is much of Chopin&#39;s own originality.The opening theme, in F major, is in the rhythm of a mazurka.  A second theme, in B-flat, marked Tranquillamente e cantabile, appears, before the main theme returns.  The piece is notable for Chopin&#39;s very early use of the sharpened 4th degree characteristic of the Lydian mode.Robert Schumann first heard the Rondo à la mazur in 1836, and he called it &quot;lovely, enthusiastic and full of grace.  He who does not yet know Chopin had best begin the acquaintance with this piece&quot;.</literal></binding>

It was first performed at the Théâtre de l&#39;Odéon in Paris on April 11, 1873. The first staged performance took place in Nice on February 9, 1903. It was Massenet&#39;s first success and won him the praise of Tchaikovsky, Gounod and Bizet.The story concerns the last days of Jesus from the perspective of Mary Magdalene.  The subject initially caused some controversy, as some believed that physical love was implied between Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  From today&#39;s perspective those implications are difficult to detect.  While it contains some beautiful music and has been revived for certain singers, notably Régine Crespin, the work has not endured and is rarely performed.</literal></binding>

It premiered on 26 December 1880 in Vienna. Most performances last between twelve and fifteen minutes.Brahms chose the title &quot;Tragic&quot; to emphasize the turbulent, tormented character of the piece, in essence a free-standing symphonic movement, in contrast to the mirthful ebullience of a companion piece he wrote the same year, the Academic Festival Overture. Despite its name, the Tragic Overture does not follow any specific dramatic program. Brahms was not very interested in musical storytelling and was more concerned with conveying and eliciting emotional impressions. He summed up the effective difference between the two overtures when he declared &quot;one laughs while the other cries.&quot; Brahms quotes some material from the last movement of the Second Symphony in this overture.The Tragic Overture comprises three main sections, all in the key of D minor.Allegro ma non troppoMolto più moderatoTempo primo ma tranquillo.Theorists have disagreed in analyzing the form of the piece: Jackson finds Webster&#39;s multifarious description rather obscurist and prefers to label the work&#39;s form as a &quot;reversed sonata design&quot; in which the second group is recapitulated before the first, with Beethoven&#39;s Coriolan Overture as a possible formal model.</literal></binding>

The main C minor theme represents Coriolanus&#39; resolve and war-like tendencies (he is about to invade Rome), while the more tender E-flat major theme represents the pleadings of his mother to desist. Coriolanus eventually gives in to tenderness, but since he cannot turn back having led an army of his former enemies to Rome&#39;s gates, he kills himself. (In Shakespeare&#39;s play, on the other hand, he is murdered.)The overture was premiered in March 1807 at a private concert in the home of Prince Franz Joseph von Lobkowitz.

With the subtitle Ballade Créole, it was first published in 1849 by Gottschalk&#39;s publisher &#39;Escudiers&#39; and again in 1850 by Editions Schott, with a dedication to Maria II of Portugal on the composer&#39;s assumption that a trip from Madrid to Lisbon during his concert tour in the spring of that year would be likely to happen.</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118, are some of the most beloved items that the composer Johannes Brahms wrote for the solo instrument.  Completed in 1893 and dedicated to Clara Schumann, the collection was the second to last composition to be published during Brahms&#39; lifetime. It was also his second to last work composed for piano solo. Like Brahms&#39; other late keyboard works, Op. 118 is overall more introspective than his earlier piano pieces, which tend to be more virtuosic in character. The six pieces are:No. 1.  Intermezzo in A minor.  Allegro non assai, ma molto appassionatoNo. 2.  Intermezzo in A major.  Andante teneramente[1]No. 3.  Ballade in G minor.  Allegro energicoNo. 4.  Intermezzo in F minor.  Allegretto un poco agitatoNo. 5.  Romanze in F major.  AndanteNo. 6.  Intermezzo in E flat minor.  Andante, largo e mesto</literal></binding>

   <binding name="desc"><literal xml:lang="en">The Overture in the French style, BWV 831, original title Ouvertüre nach Französischer Art, also known as the French Overture and published as the second half of Clavier-Übung II in 1735 (paired with the Italian Concerto), is a suite in B minor for two-manual harpsichord written by Johann Sebastian Bach.  An earlier version of this work exists, in the key of C minor (BWV 831a); the work was transposed into B minor to complete the cycle of tonalities in Parts One and Two of the Clavier-Übung. The term overture refers to the fact that this suite starts with an overture movement, and was a common generic name for French suites (his orchestral suites were similarly named).  This &quot;overture&quot; movement replaces the allemande found in Bach&#39;s other keyboard suites.  Also, there are optional dance movements both before and after the Sarabande. Optional movements usually occur only after the sarabande.  All three of the optional dance movements are presented in pairs, with the first one repeated (without internal repeats) after the second.  Also unusual is the inclusion of an extra movement after the Gigue.  This is an &quot;echo&quot;, a piece meant to exploit the terraced loud and soft dynamics of the two-manual harpsichord.  Other movements also have dynamic indications (piano and forte), which are not often found in keyboard suites of the Baroque period.  With eleven movements, the French Overture is the longest keyboard suite ever composed by Bach. It usually has a duration of 30 minutes if all the repeats in every movement are taken.Movements:OvertureCouranteGavotte I/II Passepied I/II SarabandeBourrée I/II Gigue EchoThe style of this work refers to composers like François Couperin who had published compositions in this suite format. Such suites had been composed for both solo instruments and for orchestral settings. Bach&#39;s composition, though a work for solo harpsichord, employs a fuller sound than was customary for the French composers to whom he referred.</literal></binding>

Intended originally as a ballade, the piece was reworked to its present form and entitled Prelude. Despite the fact that both hands have beautiful melodies indicated with tenutos in bars 1–3–9–11, and the alto voice in the 16, the one for the left hand seems to take the credit as the most beautiful between the two. Tenths arpeggiated in bars 20–23 lead to the top note of the chord to fall on the beat.This composition&#39;s structural form is A (bars 1–8), A repeated (9–14), bridge (15–19), and coda (20–24), being that the second phrase repeates the first a fourth lower. It is 24 bars long with a Lento tempo marking, and it takes about two minutes to be played.</literal></binding>
